# Jobly

### Jobly is a full stack web app built with React, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and Bootstrap

- Inspired by job application web apps like LinkedIn or Angel List.
- This project is a part of <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/">RITHM</a> school's curriculum. It was done in collaboration with my partner <a href="https://github.com/jessicachen-48">Jessica Chen</a>.

### To get started

- `cd` into project directory
- `npm i`

### How it works

- Users can do the following:
  - Login, signup, edit profile
  - Search for a job or company
  - Apply for a job (by clicking on the apply button, which will add this job to the user's applied jobs in the db)
  - Obtain details about a job or company

### Features

- Authentication with <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a>.
- API calls are made to the <a href="https://github.com/kathythekat/Express-Jobly">Jobly backend</a>.
